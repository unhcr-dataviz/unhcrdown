## Resubmission Notes

This is a resubmission of version 0.6.0 of the `unhcrdown` package to CRAN. In response to CRAN's request, runnable examples have been added to all exported functions. Since the examples require Pandoc to execute, they are wrapped in `\dontrun{}` to avoid issues in automated testing environments.
